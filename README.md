# My Awesome Project
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, passport.js

Back-end made entirely with Node.js. I used Sessions for authentication, and the Model View Controller (MCV) model to organize my code. <br>
The .env file was included my .gitignore. <br>
Be sure to include an .env file that includes a: <br>
PORT = XXXX <br>
MONGO_URI = XXX (connection to MongoBD with your user and pass) <br>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = XXX <br>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = XXX <br>



## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
